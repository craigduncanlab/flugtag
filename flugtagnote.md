HARD-CORE FLUGTAG BELOW - READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK

================================

The following topics are included for those who like more detail and theory.

1. Centre of Gravity.
The centre of gravity idea and neutral point will really help with our front wing placement and nose length.   Even uses the simple 'arrow' idea.
2. Theory (lift equation etc) - in case you want more!
3. Glider Design Refs - some design 'rules of thumb' but I actually found the Centre of Grav video a better explanation of what they were talking about.
4. Toy Balsa refs (other examples but our cardboard design seems like a pretty good start.  Star Wars ones for fun later).

Having the ability to easily shift the wing position and tail-section length could be really helpful for experiments next week etc.

*Lift ideas*

Some people will provide the old explanation that air travelling further over the curved upper surface of a bent wing generates lift because the air is travelling faster.  This is summarised fairly well here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)

The more modern explanation is, however, more complicated.  It is generally that lift is generated by how the air moves around and relative to the object, causing pressure differences, and not a simple 'distance' theory.  So if you can generate turbulent, low pressure flow on one side of the vehicle, relative to the other, you can control the direction of the net 'lift' force.

The modern lift equation is here:

https://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/lifteq.html

It states that lift is equal to the lift coefficient*(Cl)*times the density of the air*(r)*times half of thesquare of the velocity <https://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/vel.html>*(V)*times the wing area*(A)*.

L = .5 * Cl * r * V^2 * A 

# Centre of Gravity YouTube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URglaHEt5Pk

This is a very good explanation, specifically for models.

Includes recommendation that centre of gravity should be about 1/4 from leading edge(front of) main large wing (longitudinal)

A high wing plane (i.e. wing on top of body), when in higher angle of attack, shifts centre of gravity slightly forward.

You then have to consider how this relates to the central pressure or neutral point of a plane.

For stable plane, you need these to be aft of COG:

aerodynamic center, center of pressure.
aerodynamic center: relates only to the airfoil.  It's a point inside the wing 
centre of pressure: 
neutral point: this is somewhere, typically behind main wing, taking into account stabilisers etc.


The greater the distance between the COG and the neutral point (behind it), the more stable the flight.

Sweeping wings are one way of increasing the amount of surface area behind COG.
(wings/tail-less planes have the wings swept back..)

More traditional way: add horiz/vert stabilisers (rear tail)
factors: size, and length of fuselage.   But this adds weight.  Eventually the tail moment arm gets too heavy.

# Lift (Theory)

Theory

The old explanation of lift (airfoils) is that air travelling further over the curved upper surface of a bent wing generates lift because the air is travelling faster.  This is summarised fairly well here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)

The more modern explanation is, however, more complicated.  It is generally that lift is generated by how the air moves around and relative to the object, causing pressure differences, and not a simple 'distance' theory.  So if you can generate turbulent, low pressure flow on one side of the vehicle, relative to the other, you can control the direction of the net 'lift' force.

The modern lift equation is here:

https://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/lifteq.html

It states that lift is equal to the lift coefficient (Cl) times the density of the air (r) times half of the square of the velocity (V) times the wing area (A).

L = .5 * Cl * r * V^2 * A

Density of air

Outside our control.  But perhaps density and drag are secretly involved in deciding the lift coefficient (see below).

Velocity

Throw speed, and also the aerodynamic design keeps this higher for longer.

Area (wing)

This assumes that the area is a wing i.e. interacting horizontally with the fluid, perpendicular to the direction of the movement of the object in the fluid/air.  

Lift coefficient

What is the 'lift coefficient'?

This is empirical (no easy formula for it).    If you change something for lift, you might increase drag as well.

But as a guide, they say that increasing the angle of attack of a thin wing (airfoil) allows you to generate a higher lift coefficient.

"in general, this parameter is determined experimentally using models in a wind tunnel. For thin airfoils, at small angles of attack, the lift coefficient is approximately two times pi (3.14159) times the angle of attack expressed in radians.

Cl = 2 * pi * angle (in radians)"

Mathematically, the angle be limited to between 0 degrees (0 radians) and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) or it doesn't make sense.  A wing perpendicular to the air flow generates pi^2 lift coefficient (maximum).  That's about 9.86 (scalar). 

But in practice it only works for 'small angles of attack', which appears to be <15-20 degrees (about one third of a radian).  See this primary-school level explanation https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/WindTunnel/Activities/lift_formula.html (US units unfortunately)
A similar discussion is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack

The 'stall angle' is when the angle of attack is above the maximum lift generated.   If the wind is upward, a wing that has a default angle of attack below stall might be pushed into the stall angle.   The stall angle is also a function of the horizontal velocity, so a glider that is thrown hard might be okay initially, but if the velocity falls too quickly, it might stall because the plane's upward motion increases drag, increasing the slowing down in a feedback loop.

Per 'angle of attack' wiki:

"The airspeed at which the aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft, the load factor, the center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors. However, the aircraft always stalls at the same critical angle of attack. The critical or stalling angle of attack is typically around 15° - 20° for many airfoils."

Load factor

From wiki:

In aeronautics, the load factor is the ratio of the lift of an aircraft to its weight[1][2]:§ 5.22 and represents a global measure of the stress ("load") to which the structure of the aircraft is subjected:

    n={\frac {L}{W}}

where:

    n = Load factor
    L = Lift
    W = Weight

Since the load factor is the ratio of two forces, it is dimensionless. However, its units are traditionally referred to as g, because of the relation between load factor and apparent acceleration of gravity felt on board the aircraft. A load factor of one, or 1 g, represents conditions in straight and level flight, where the lift is equal to the weight. Load factors greater or less than one (or even negative) are the result of maneuvers or wind gusts.[3]

Tailplane (rear horizontal stabliser)

If we had the ability to adjust the angle of the tailplane, we might be able to stabilise the flight of the glider:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailplane

Our experiments yesterday and angle of attack

Yesterday had set the wing in the plane at a zero angle of attack, so initially it depends on the angle of the throw.

In actual flight, the angle of the wing to air will then be determined by (a) wind direction and (b) the relative weight between front and back of plane changing its flight angle (c) effects of drag etc.  

Trial 1

We got too much lift when the back was too heavy, relative to the front, for the speed (i.e. stall = no more air speed over the wing and no lift).    A more balanced plane doesn't force itself into stall so quickly...

We adjusted the weight of the plane (i.e. rather than the wing angle), which tended to reduce the actual angle of attack of the wing, regardless of its angle to the body of the plane.

This would suggest that if we set the wing in with a slight upward angle, we might need an even heavier nose section, relative to the back, to achieve more level flight and keep air moving over the wing in a horizontal direction.

Alternatively, if we had a way to change the wing angle (e.g. we pin it between two bits of wood, and can adjust it, then we might be able to fine tune it (rather than just build a static model).

Trial 2

With increased wing area, we expect even more lift (but some extra weight).  The increase in lift for wing area is linear, but the weight increase (or downward force) is based on mass*gravity (e.g. mass x 9.8).   The trade-off between area and downward force to give net lift must depend on the type of material.

We might have increased lift so much that we were then trying to change the attack angle crudely by changing the weight transfer.

Gliders

It's interesting to consider the design of hang gliders.

e.g. this F2: https://airborne.com.au/images/manuals/8439.pdf

This has a wing area of 17.7m^2, and a stall speed of about 40km/h and manuoevring speed of ~70km/h. 

The nose angle is 118 degrees.   I suppose this could be described as an attack angle of 62 degrees?

The glider weight is 23kg, with pilot weight of 70kg plus (so overall weight around 93kg to 140kg)

# Glider Design Refs

## Easy ratios:

Scrap glider design should keep these things in mind:

1. The ratio of area of tail wing to main wing should be about 1/3 (and less than 1/2).  
2. Keep width (front to back) of both wings identical.
3. The centre of gravity of plane should lie where torque by buoyancy force of air due to both wings is zero.
4. You must adjust buoyancy AND centre of gravity at same time?  Or use an adjustable nose weight etc.

(Adapted from https://hubpages.com/games-hobbies/how-to-design-a-glider-plane-model-at-home)

As to points 3 and 4:
The wing should be placed at the centre of gravity
The centre of gravity should be at a point between the nose and tail such that lifting force of the wing would not cause a torque effect on the body.

What does this mean?
 - The body of the plane should be lifted evenly upward (not nose up first at sharp angle to flip, nor nose down first)
 - Lift should be as perpendicular to flying direction as possible.

This seems easy but is difficult to achieve.  Once achieved, your glider should fly!

Some other advice:

```
" I would slide the main wing forward if the glide tests showed a tendency for the model to glide downward into a nose first hard landing. If the model normally would glide forward, climb a little, stall, nose downward, pick up airspeed, climb a little, stall, and nose downward again, I knew the main wing needed to be moved backward a little in the slot, or on the stick. I would continue to adjust the position of the main wing until the balsa profile toy airplane would glide forward in a constant, smooth glide path until it landed smoothly on the ground without any signs of stress, or damage to the soft wood fuselage. This may seem like a simple thing to do, but it is the starting point for determining the best location for the balance point for a common aircraft configuration. It also works if testing for CG on odd configurations of model aircraft."

"[If] the main wings have a fixed location with no forward, or rearward adjustments possible, the only option is to add a small amount of weight were needed."

"As the model design gets bigger and heavier, the balance point (CG) will be moved as needed for the best flight characteristics, but the adjustments are normally very slight. This is easily demonstrated by making larger copies of the same design using foam, balsa wood, or whatever material is deemed necessary while preserving the same wing loading numbers."

"A soft tail breeze can extend the glide slope before ground contact and a head breeze can shorten the distance the glider will go before ground contact unless it provides a slight up draft. If the updraft is more than slight, the glider might stay airborne for a significant distance, which is why many RC model aircraft glider designers seek a hill, or higher elevation with a constant wind blowing towards the higher point of launch."

"What birds do at low airspeed is change the configuration of their wings airfoil shape ever so slightly to maximize the lift provided by the updraft and wind. 

Engineers have schemed how this could be duplicated in mechanical and "soft wing" designs for many years. Mechanical wing designs use flaps on the trailing edge of the wing at lower airspeeds and slats that slide down and forward from the wing's leading edge. The effect is to give the wing an undercamber that approaches what is observed while watching birds glide. What that means is the bottom of the wing airfoil isn't flat, but curves inward, which acts upon the air moving past the bottom of the wing and forms a vacuum. We can modify the toy glider wing so the bottom has the same shape, or curve towards the surface of the top of the wing. The curve will need to be minor, or shallow to preserve the strength of the foam, or the wing is likely to fail during flight by folding, falling apart, cracking, or some other undesirable defect. There are ways to strengthen a foam wing with more than a minor undercamber, but they normally add enough weight to off-set the benefits of the effect. Even so, we ma"
